     Progress DataDirect
     Bulk Load Example Readme File

The Bulk Load example is a sample application that demonstrates the 
bulk export, load, and validate operations of DataDirect Bulk Load.

The Bulk Load example prompts the user for the type of bulk operation 
to perform and the necessary table, file, and option information needed 
to perform the selected operation.

For your applications to use DataDirect Bulk Load functionality, 
they must obtain driver connection handles and function pointers. The 
Bulk Load example illustrates the following steps needed to acquire the 
bulk load function pointers:

1. Use SQLGetInfo with the parameter SQL_DRIVER_HDBC to obtain the 
driver's connection handle from the Driver Manager.

2. Use SQLGetInfo with the parameter SQL_DRIVER_HLIB to obtain the 
driver's shared library or DLL handle from the Driver Manager.

3. Obtain function pointers to the bulk load functions using the 
function name resolution method specific to your operating system. The 
bulk.c application contains the function resolveName that illustrates 
how to obtain function pointers to the bulk load functions.

To execute the application, on a command line enter:

bulk <connection_string>

Where <connection_string> is the connection information for the 
database to which you want to connect for either exporting data, 
validating data, or bulk loading data. Follow the prompts to choose the 
operation you want to perform on that database and enter other 
information necessary to complete the bulk operation.

You can view the provided source code, bulk.c, to see specifically 
commented code. The functions are fully described in the "DataDirect 
Bulk Load" chapter of the DATADIRECT CONNECT(R) SERIES FOR ODBC 
REFERENCE.

Windows
-------
The Bulk Load application can be built from the following files, 
located in the \SAMPLES\BULK directory of the DataDirect Connect Series 
for ODBC installation directory:

BULK.C            Bulk example source
BULK.EXE          Bulk application
BULK.SLN          Bulk example solution file
BULK.VCPROJ       Bulk example project file
BULK.MAK          Bulk example make file (instead of .SLN and .VCPROJ 
                  files on Itanium 64 only)

UNIX
----
Instructions for building the Bulk Load application are contained 
inside the file bulk.mak, which can be read with a text editor. The 
application can be built from the following files, located in the 
/samples/bulk directory of the DataDirect Connect Series for ODBC 
installation directory:

bulk                Bulk application
bulk.c              Bulk example source
bulk.mak            Bulk example make file
