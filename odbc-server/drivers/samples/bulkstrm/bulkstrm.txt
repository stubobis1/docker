     Bulk Streaming Application Readme File

The Bulk Streaming application is a sample application that 
demonstrates how to export data from one data source and upload it into 
another without going through an intermediate file.


EXECUTING THE APPLICATION

Windows - Command Line
----------------------
Following is the syntax to execute the application from a command line:

bulkstrm "<source_connect_string>" "<source-SQL>" "<dest_table_name>"  
["<dest_connect_string>"] [-maxBindSize xxxx] [-numRows xxx] [-Unicode]

Where:

<source_connect_string> - is the connection string used to connect to 
the data source from which the data will be exported.

<source-SQL> - is the SQL statement used to generate the source data 
for the bulk load.

<dest_table_name> - is the name of the destination table where the data 
is loaded.

dest_connect_string - is an optional argument that specifies the 
connection information for the destination data source. If omitted, the 
destination connection information is assumed to be the same as the 
source connection information.

-maxBindSize xxxx - is an optional argument that specifies the maximum 
size for column bindings. The default is 4096.

-numRows xxx - is an optional argument that specifies the number of 
rows to load at a time. The default is 128.

-Unicode - is an optional argument that forces all character data to be 
bound as SQL_C_WCHAR to reconcile any character set differences.

Note that the three required arguments must be entered in the correct 
order. The optional arguments do not have to be listed in a specific 
order; they can follow the required arguments in any order.

The following are command line examples:

bulkstrm "DSN=DB2source1" "SELECT * FROM Account" "Account2" 
"DSN=DB2source3" -Unicode -maxBindSize 8192 -numRows 500

In the first example, DB2source1 contains connection information for 
the source data; the SQL statement selects data from the table Account; 
the data is loaded into the table Acccount2; the connection information 
for Account2 is contained in DB2source3; all character data is bound as 
SQL_C_WCHAR; the maximum size for column binding is 8192; and the 
number of rows to load at a time is 500.

bulkstrm "DSN=Oraclesource2;uid=user1;pwd=mypassword" "SELECT * FROM 
Address" "NewAddress"

In the second example, Oraclesource2 does not contain the UserID and 
Password within the data source, so it must be specified in the 
connection string; the SQL statement selects data from the table 
Address; the data is loaded into the table NewAddress; the connection 
information for NewAddress is the same as for the source data and does 
not need to be specified; the maximum size for column binding is 4096 
(the default); and the number of rows to load at a time is 128 (the 
default).

If you do not specify sufficient connection information, Windows 
prompts you with a dialog box. Any other errors or messages are 
detailed in a separate Bulk Streaming Messages window that remains open 
as long as the Bulk Steaming application is open.

Windows - GUI
-------------
You can also run application as a GUI by executing bulkstrm.exe. Doing 
so displays a screen with controls that correspond to the previously 
described arguments as follows:

Input Data Source - is a drop-down list from which you can select 
existing DataDirect Connect Series for ODBC data sources that contain 
the data to be loaded.

Input Connection String - is an edit field in which you enter 
additional connection string information, for example, UserID and 
Password.

Input SQL Statement - is an edit field in which you enter a SQL 
Statement, including the table name from which the data is generated.

Output Table - is an edit field in which you enter the name of the 
destination table where the data is loaded.

Output Data Source - is a drop-down list from which you can select an 
existing DataDirect Connect Series for ODBC data source as the 
destination for the bulk load; or, you can select <Same as Input Data 
Source>.

Output Connection String - is an edit field in which you can, 
optionally, enter connection information for the destination data 
source. If omitted, the destination connection information is assumed 
to be the same as the source connection information.

Maximum Binding - is an edit field in which you, optionally, specify 
the maximum size for column bindings. The default is 4096.

Number of Rows - is an edit field in which you, optionally, specify the 
number of rows to load at a time. The default is 128.

Unicode - is a check box. When enabled, all character data is bound as 
SQL_C_WCHAR to reconcile any character set differences. When disabled 
(the default), character data is not bound as SQL_C_WCHAR.
See the examples in the description of the command line version of the 
application for samples of strings that might be entered in the GUI.

If you do not specify sufficient connection information, Windows 
prompts you with a dialog box. Any other errors or messages are 
detailed in a separate Bulk Streaming Messages window that remains open 
as long as the Bulk Steaming application is open.

UNIX/Linux
----------
The application runs on UNIX/Linux from a command line only, the syntax 
of which is identical to Windows. See the description of the Windows 
command line version of the application. The UNIX/Linux version does 
not prompt you for any connection information.


BUILDING THE APPLICATION

Windows
-------
The Bulk Streaming application can be built from the following files, 
located in the \SAMPLES\BULKSTRM directory of the DataDirect Connect 
Series for ODBC installation directory:

BULK.CPP                Bulk streaming example source
BULK.HPP                Bulk streaming example header
BULK.RC                 Bulk streaming example resource file
BULKSTREAMING.SLN       Bulk streaming example solution file
BULKSTREAMING.VCPROJ    Bulk streaming example project file
BULKSTRM.EXE            Bulk streaming example application
MSGPRINTF.HPP           Bulk streaming example header file
PROGRESSDATADIRECT.BMP
PROGRESSDATADIRECT.ICO
WINMAIN.CPP             Bulk streaming example source file
STREAMBULK.MAK          Bulk streaming example make file (instead of 
                        .SLN and .VCPROJ files on Itanium 64 only)

UNIX
----
Instructions for building the Bulk Streaming application are contained 
inside the file bulk.mak, which can be read with a text editor. The 
application can be built from the following files, located in the 
/samples/bulkstrm directory of the DataDirect Connect Series for ODBC 
installation directory:

bulk.cpp        Bulk streaming example source
bulk.hpp        Bulk streaming example header
bulkstrm        Bulk streaming example application
main.cpp        Bulk streaming example source file
msgprintf.hpp   Bulk streaming example header file
streambulk.mak  Bulk streaming example make file
